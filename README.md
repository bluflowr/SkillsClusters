# SkillsClusters
This application parses software developer job ads and determines, for each technical skill keyword (e.g. Python, Java, C#, Javascript, etc) what other skills are most likely to go with it (e.g. for Python it would be Django, Flask, etc.) So when one is preparing for a software development interview, one could know what other areas they need to study to answer the most likely interview questions.

This application was originally created at the Austin Ladies Hack hackathon in August of 2014.
